# Wave Function Collapse Map Generator

This project is a **tile-based map generator** built with **Phaser.js** that uses the **Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm** to generate procedurally generated maps. Each map includes varied regions of water and land, with additional decoration tiles like trees and buildings, providing a visually appealing, varied terrain.

## Features

- **Procedural Map Generation**: Randomly generates maps using WFC, creating coherent regions of water and land.
- **Decoration Layer**: Adds randomized decorations like trees and buildings on land tiles for extra detail.
- **Interactive Regeneration**: Press `R` to regenerate the map and get a new layout each time.

## Controls

- **Press `R`**: Regenerates the map with a new random layout.
